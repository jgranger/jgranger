### Greetings ðŸ‘‹

I live in Bay View, Washington and currently manage the Core Messaging Team at <a href='https://www.tatango.com/' target='_blank'>Tatango</a>. I've been developing software professionally since 2002 and while I have a lot of experience I'm constantly learning new things. That's what I love about this industry, there's a non-stop need to learn and improve upon so many different types of skills. 

My professional experience is quite diverse. I have worked for small to medium sized companies, Fortune 500 companies, various Federal and State agencies, and many different vertical markets including payment processing, health care, manufacturing, B2B, B2C, agri-tech and more. I worked for a couple of startups that were acquired and one that was not. 

### My Management Style
I like to build self managing teams to the best of my ability using tight feedback loops, always iterating together towards perfection. I try to lead by conversational concensus whenever possible. Unity is something I seek and a high perfoming team demands it. People don't always have to agree, but when we make decisions together we all get behind them.

While a SDM's life is primarily people, process and projects it's important to me to stay close to the implementation. I'm a manager who commits and merges PR's daily, performs code reviews just like any other team member, while making sure our release process is running smooth and our customers are happy.
